 - 01-03. datetimes  
 Fairly simple. I'd like to go back and look at the *Python Standard Library Cookbook* to see how to do month arithmetic
 - 04-06. collections  
 Some good fun. Downloaded some data from kaggle to play with
 - 07-09. datastructures  
 Straightforward but interesting use of chain.from_iterables to flatten a list of lists. Also the more obscure `sum(cars.values(), [])`
 - 10-12. pytest.  
 Some great examples of simple games and how to test them. Need to go back and look at this more carefully.
